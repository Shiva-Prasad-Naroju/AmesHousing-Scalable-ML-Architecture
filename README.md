🏡 AmesHousing Sale Price Prediction

## **📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting **Sale Prices** using the **AmesHousing dataset**. Initially, the dataset contained numerous features, requiring careful selection and processing. The project follows a structured approach by leveraging **design patterns** to enhance maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

## **🎯 Design Patterns Implemented**

To maintain a clean and modular code structure, multiple **design patterns** were implemented. These patterns helped in organizing various components systematically and improving flexibility.

### **🔹 Abstract Method Pattern (Abstract Base Class)**

- Implemented using **Python's `abc` module`**.
  
- Ensures a **common interface** for all method implementations.
  
- Enforces consistency across different strategies used in the project.
  
- Helps in maintaining a **clear separation of concerns** by defining methods that must be implemented in child classes.

## 💡 **How It Helped?**

- Allowed easy extension of functionalities without modifying existing code.
  
- Improved **code readability** and **reusability**.
  
- Encouraged a structured approach to defining multiple strategies.

## **📂 Project Structure**

The project is well-structured, separating concerns into dedicated folders. A key directory is:

### 📁 `explanations/`

This folder contains documentation and examples of different **design patterns** used, such as:

- **Factory Design Pattern** 🏭
  
- **Strategy Design Pattern** 🎯
  
- **Template Design Pattern** 📑

## **💡 Reusability & Professional Implementation ✨🔄💻**

Since this project is built entirely using Abstract Method Patterns 🏗️, the implemented methods can be reused 🔄 in other projects as a reference 📖. 

This structured approach enhances code maintainability 🛠️, making development more professional 👨‍💻🎯 and efficient ⚡. 

Adopting this design pattern ensures that future projects are easier to implement 🚀 and follow a consistent & scalable architecture 🏢📈


## **🚀 Conclusion**

The Random Forest Regressor model shows a good fit with an R² of 0.9, indicating it explains 90% of the variance in the data.

The low MSE, RMSE, and MAE values suggest strong predictive accuracy, while the MAPE of 7.23% indicates reasonably low prediction error.

By incorporating design patterns, this project effectively manages complexity and enhances modularity. The use of **abstract method patterns** ensures a solid foundation for adding new features with minimal code modification.
