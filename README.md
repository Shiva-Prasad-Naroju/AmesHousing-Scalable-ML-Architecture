# 🏡 AmesHousing Sale Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **Sale Prices** using the **AmesHousing dataset**. Initially, the dataset contained numerous features, requiring careful selection and processing. The project follows a structured approach by leveraging **design patterns** to enhance maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

## 🎯 Design Patterns Implemented
To maintain a clean and modular code structure, multiple **design patterns** were implemented. These patterns helped in organizing various components systematically and improving flexibility.

### 🔹 Abstract Method Pattern (Abstract Base Class)
- Implemented using **Python's `abc` module`**.
- Ensures a **common interface** for all method implementations.
- Enforces consistency across different strategies used in the project.
- Helps in maintaining a **clear separation of concerns** by defining methods that must be implemented in child classes.

💡 **How It Helped?**
- Allowed easy extension of functionalities without modifying existing code.
- Improved **code readability** and **reusability**.
- Encouraged a structured approach to defining multiple strategies.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is well-structured, separating concerns into dedicated folders. A key directory is:

### 📁 `explanations/`
This folder contains documentation and examples of different **design patterns** used, such as:
- **Factory Design Pattern** 🏭
- **Strategy Design Pattern** 🎯
- **Template Design Pattern** 📑

These patterns ensure that the system is flexible, scalable, and maintainable, making future enhancements easier.

## 🚀 Conclusion
By incorporating design patterns, this project effectively manages complexity and enhances modularity. The use of **abstract method patterns** ensures a solid foundation for adding new features with minimal code modification. 

Happy Coding! 😊
